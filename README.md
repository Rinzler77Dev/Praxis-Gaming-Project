Project for 1st Year 2nd Semester Praxis Programming under Keiran O'Leary.
Goal is to make a game, ive decided to aim for a text adventure taking inspiraton from final fantasy like RPG games.
This is my first proper venture in to C/C++, having to apply what i learned from the lectures or even learn a bit more than what was taught this year.
I know its no masterpiece like others in the class might have made, but i learned alot from it, im proud of it and i think it's a good representation of my best abilities at this moment in time. (March 2025)
